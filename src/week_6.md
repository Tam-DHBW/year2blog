# Blog Entry 5 â€“ IDE Integration and Reports

Hello everyone!
This week we sadly have not made any development progress on our project.
However, we did of course do the mandatory homework:

## IDE Integration

## YouTrack Reports
First of all, if you want to take a look at how our project is progressing, [you can view our scrum board here](https://dhbw-newstudy.youtrack.cloud/agiles/108-175/current).

As you can see in this burndown chart from the beginning to the end of the semester, our project is progressing quite well.

We also take care of current issues relatively quyickly:

For the amout of time spent by RUP workflow, we sadly misconfigured YouTrack initially and were only able to set tracking the workflow up properly this week.
Due to this we dont have a proper history for our report:

Nevertheless you can very clearly see that we spent a perhaps unproportionally large amount of time on implementation so far.
What can i say, we just really like developing our project ðŸ˜‰
