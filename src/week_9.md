# Week 9 - Restrospective

Hello everyone!

Sorry for being a bit late with our blog post, we were not aware we also had to do one for this week.

Anyway, this week we had the retrospective with Nadine Schwarz.

We really thought hard how we could improve working on our project in the next semester,
however we noticed that we were doing a really good job with our project.
- We have a functional backend
- We have a functional frontend
- The frontend looks great
- The game is not completed, but already very much playable
- Our game is really fun :D
- We have fully deployed everything and it is publicly accessible
- We are almost done with our documentation
- Our time management was pretty good
- We had great teamwork

You can definitely look forward to our demo next week and try out our game yourself!

See you next time, and good luck with your own projects!
