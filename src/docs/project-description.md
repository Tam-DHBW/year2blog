<!-- ANCHOR: desc -->

Our project is a game called 🎮 jAilbreak.
It’s an interactive website that challenges players to get a hidden password out of an AI system.
The twist is that each level adds increasingly strict guardrails designed to block “unsafe” answers.
Players have to use different jailbreaking techniques to bypass these restrictions and succeed in obtaining the password.

It does not have any inherent dependencies on specific outside systems, though we are making great use of AWS services.
