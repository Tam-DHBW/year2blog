# Use cases

<!--the UCD is correct (UML with 5 components: actors, system boundary,  UC, association, dependencies AND scope marked in grey or color)-->
<!--each bubble in UCD contains a “verb”-->
<!--SCOPE of 5 Use cases should be colored (plan to December delivery)-->
<!---->
<!--at least 2 Use Cases are uploaded to git in documentation (separate from code) format is MD-->
<!--(LOGIN/OUT does not count – nor Logout by the way)-->
<!--UC contains: screenshot/Mockup/Wireframe and activity diagram,-->
<!--UC shows version control in some way (git has version conrol)-->
<!--UC does not have to contain short description yet (soon .features  files are due and relate to this part – so this will be inserted later  on)-->
<!--UC uses official RUP template outline-->
<!--UC is clear and understandable and covers exactly one goal the user is trying to achieve. (verb)-->
<!--UC is linked to from SRS-->
<!--UC is marked as a CRUD if it is one-->

<!--Narrative(which is test-code) is linked to from UC document or updated in the .md file-->
<!--Narrative follows correct Syntax (https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/)-->
<!--feature: USE CASE NAME-->
<!-- as a ACTOR-->
<!-- I want to DESCRIPTION-->
<!--scenario: correct login-->
<!-- Given __-->
<!-- When __-->
<!-- Then __-->
<!-- etc.-->
<!--Each Narrative (.feature) has more than one scenario.-->
<!--Scenarios agree with Activity Diagram paths (happy path 80% all is well: ex. login success, vs. unhappy path – problems happen: ex. login  failed)-->
<!--2 Use Cases are finished including Screenshot, Narration, Activity Diagram (correct UML)-->
<!--Proof that IDE has correct formatting and color highlighting for .feature file (screenshot)-->
<!--Proof that you used autocompletion on step definitions  within your IDE-->
<!---->
<!--(the location of .feature text in UC document is variable. I  personally like it when the text is right next to the activity diagram  so that you can read the text for the flow that you see in the diagram.  But you can do this as you wish. See what your peer reviewers say about  how they like it.)-->
