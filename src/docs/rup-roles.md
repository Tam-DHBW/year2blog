# RUP roles

<!--assign RUP roles or better disciplines (same as RUP workflows) to  your team-members (no need to use all, stick to the basic high-level  ones)-->
<!--remember: everyone (except MC) has to code, roles can change over time-->

> Since we are a small team of two, we chose RUP disciples instead of roles.
