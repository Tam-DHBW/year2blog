# Blog Entry 8 – UML Diagram (aka #WhyDoWeHaveSoManyDiagrams)
Since we’re not exactly fans of drawing diagrams by hand, we decided to automate the process a bit using AI. By letting Amazon Q analyze our codebase, it generated a solid initial UML diagram that we later refined and adjusted manually. You can check out the final version below.

Right now, we’re focusing on improving the admin panel — making level creation easier, automating repetitive tasks, and building a system for prompt re-use. This should make the whole level creation process more agile and transparent for us, and ultimately lead to a smoother user experience.

So, enjoy exploring our UML diagram!
